//stack trace is finding where the function is invoked and where the problem is.

//using the debugger, if you have a var declared, it pauses for it to executes before going to the next line

//even though you step out the function will be invoked..

//if you step into the console log, it takes you to the virtual machine

//put a debugger before the error is
//Code still gets executed if there is an error when using a debugger
//write a debugger if the statement is undefined

//the bug will be what you have typed before the bug
//Data Structure
//Efficiency
//STACK
//stack is a collection of last item in and first out
//Queue is a collection of first item in last item out

//this is all wrong
//git remote add joksina path
//git push origin master
//git push --force username master
